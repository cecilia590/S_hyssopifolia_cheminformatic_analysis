# **Chemotaxonomic insights and hypoglycemic potential of Sida hyssopifolia from the Mexican cloud forest: a first record via UPLC-MS metabolomics and cheminformatics**

**This repository** contains supporting information, curated data, reproducible notebooks, as well as the results, for the study *“Chemotaxonomic insights and hypoglycemic potential of* Sida hyssopifolia *from the Mexican cloud forest: a first record via UPLC-MS metabolomics and cheminformatics”*.

It includes the directories **`raw_data/`**, including standardized SMILES and annotations for *S. hyssopifolia*, *S. glabra*, and *S. rhombifolia*; **`notebooks/`**, including commented, reproducible workflows for the *chemical multiverse* analysis using **PCA**—descriptor space with Lipinski/Veber + O/N counts and **t-SNE**—structure space with *Morgan* fingerprints, radius 2, 1024 bits; and **`results/`** with CSV outputs and PNG visualizations.

To reproduce, install dependencies from **`requirements.yml`** and run the notebooks in a Python editor that supports Jupyter.
